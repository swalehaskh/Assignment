However, explicit casting carries the risk of errors (such as trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer) and potential data loss, like truncating a float to an integer.

    "\n",
    "A for loop in Python is used when you know the exact number of iterations or when you want to iterate over a sequence, like a list, string, or range. It works by iterating over each item in the sequence, automatically stopping when the sequence is exhausted. This makes it ideal for situations where you have a defined set of elements to loop through or when you know beforehand how many iterations you need. For example, when using range(), the loop will run for the specified number of iterations. The loop control is based on the sequence, so it’s easy to manage and efficient when the number of iterations is predetermined.\n",

    "While Loop:\n",

    "A while loop, on the other hand, is used when you do not know the number of iterations in advance and instead want the loop to continue as long as a certain condition evaluates to True. The loop runs indefinitely until the condition becomes False. This makes the while loop more flexible than the for loop, but it also requires careful handling to ensure that the condition will eventually become False to prevent infinite loops. While loops are often used when the stopping criteria are based on dynamic conditions, such as user input or real-time calculations, rather than a set number of iterations like in a for loop.\n",
